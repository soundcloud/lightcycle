Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to LightCycle you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

All pull requests will be validated by Travis-ci in any case and must pass before being merged.

Checkstyle failures during compilation indicate errors in your style and will be displayed in the console output of the build (including in Travis-CI output), or can be viewed in the checkstyle-result.xml file.
